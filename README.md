## 🌍 Travel Destination Recommender

This project is an intelligent travel destination recommender system built using **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)**. It helps users choose a travel destination based on their preferences such as budget, trip type, duration, and continent.

### 🔧 Technologies Used:

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, NumPy
* Joblib (for model persistence)
* Gradio (for UI)
* Hugging Face Spaces (for deployment)

### 💡 Features:

* Takes user input like **trip type**, **continent**, **budget**, and **duration**.
* Predicts suitable travel destinations using a trained ML model.
* Deployed using **Gradio** for easy interaction.
* Publicly accessible via **Hugging Face Spaces**.
